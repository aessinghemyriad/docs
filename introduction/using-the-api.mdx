title: Using the API
description: ""
---

This guide provides a foundational understanding of how to interact with the Myriad Fintech APIs. 
By following these principles, you'll be able to construct requests, handle responses, and integrate our services into your applications effectively.


## 1. Authentication 
All requests to the Myriad APIs must be authenticated using a **Bearer Token**. This token identifies your application and authorizes your access to our services.

+ Include your API token in the Authorization header of every request: <br />
`Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>`
+ Important: Replace `<YOUR_API_TOKEN>` with the actual token provided to you on the Myriad Fintech webUI. <br />

For a comprehensive guide on how to obtain and manage your API token, please visit the [Getting your token](/introduction/getting-your-token) page.

<br />

## 2. Understanding Request Structure
Myriad APIs are RESTful, meaning they use standard HTTP methods and conventions.

- **HTTP Methods**:
    - `GET`: Retrieve data (e.g., fetch details of a biller).
    - `POST`: Create new resources or perform actions (e.g., initiate a payment).
    - `PUT`: Update existing resources (replace entirely).
    - `PATCH`: Partially update existing resources.
    - `DELETE`: Remove resources.
- **Headers**:
    - `Content-Type`: Specify the format of the request body (e.g., `application/json`).
    - `Accept`: Specify the desired format for the response (e.g., `application/json`).
    - `Authorization`: Your bearer token (as described above).
    - Other custom headers may be required for specific endpoints (check the [API Reference](/api-reference/)).
- **Parameters**:
    - Path Parameters: Part of the URL path, used to identify specific resources (e.g., `/payments/{id}`).
    - Query Parameters: Appended to the URL after a `?`, used for filtering, pagination, or optional data (e.g., `/transactions?status=success&limit=10`).
    - Request Body: For `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests, the body typically contains JSON data representing the resource being created or updated.


## 5. Handling API Responses
API responses provide information about the outcome of your request.

- Successful Responses (2xx):

    - A `200 OK` generally indicates a successful request.
    - A `201 Created` means a new resource was successfully created.
    - Successful responses typically contain a JSON body with the requested data or confirmation of the action.

        ```json
        {
        "success": true,
        "message": "Payment initiated successfully.",
        "transactionId": "txn_1234567890abcdef",
        "status": "PENDING"
        }
        ```


- Error Responses (4xx, 5xx):

    - When an error occurs, the API will return an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `404 Not Found`).
    - Error responses will typically include a JSON body with an `errorCode` and a `message` to help you understand and debug the issue.

        ```json
        {
        "errorCode": "INVALID_ARGUMENT",
        "message": "The provided amount is outside the allowed range.",
        "details": [
            {"field": "amount", "issue": "Value must be between 100 and 100000"}
        ]
        }
        ```
