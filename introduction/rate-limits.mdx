title: Rate Limits
description: ""
---

To ensure fair usage and protect the performance of our APIs, Myriad enforces rate limiting on all incoming requests.

## Limit Per Environment

| Environment | Limit                | Interval        | Burst Allowed |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Production  | 1000 requests        | per minute       | Yes (up to 200)|

If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Example 429 Error Response

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": 429,
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
}
