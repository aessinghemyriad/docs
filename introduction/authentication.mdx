## API Key and Secret Authentication: Secure Access to Myriad APIs 
API Key and Secret authentication is a robust method that ensures secure communication between 
your applications and Myriad APIs. This authentication mechanism involves utilising a pair of credentials – an API Key and an API Secret – 
to establish a trusted connection. These credentials act as digital signatures, allowing you to access and interact with our APIs seamlessly.
